The media frenzy surrounding What Makes a Baby is showing no signs 
of letting up.  And really, can you blame them? Last week we got 
mentioned in the Times in an article about why our book is the most 
incredible book ever and how WMAB readers generally make the 
nicest smartest parents around.  Here's what they had to say about 
the book:<br />
"Magical illustrations and passable text make this a book that most 
people would want to buy, unless they already have books about where 
babies come from in which case, probably, they can just pass."

We've scheduled a bunch of new workshops in the North East. Check 
out the side bar and see if Cory is coming to your town. And remember, 
if he isn't, send him an email and invite him, he'd attend the opening 
of an envelope.

Let everyone know what you know with your "I Know What Makes a 
Baby" button and share the joy with the more kid-friendly (and less 
pointy!) limited edition sticker series from the book. Stickers include 
Dancing Egg & Sperm, Butterfly, Sunflowers, and the Magic 
Magnifying Glass.
